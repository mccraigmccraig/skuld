## [Unreleased]

## [0.22.0] — 2026-04-04

### Changed

- Upgraded `hex_port` dependency from `~> 0.11` to `~> 0.14`.
- `Repo.Contract` now declares 16 operations (was 15) — added `insert_all/3`.
- `Repo.Test` and `Repo.InMemory` insert/update now check `changeset.valid?`
  before applying changes — invalid changesets return `{:error, changeset}`,
  matching real Ecto.Repo behaviour.
- `Repo.Test` and `Repo.InMemory` now use `HexPort.Repo.Autogenerate` for
  primary key and timestamp autogeneration — supports `:id` (integer
  auto-increment), `:binary_id` (UUID), parameterized types (`Ecto.UUID`,
  `Uniq.UUID`), `@primary_key false` schemas, and `inserted_at`/`updated_at`
  timestamp population.
- Removed custom PK helpers from `Repo.InMemory` (`get_primary_key`,
  `put_primary_key`, `next_id`, `safe_apply_changes`) in favour of the shared
  `HexPort.Repo.Autogenerate` module.

### Added

- `Repo.Contract.insert_all/3` — bulk insert operation, dispatched via
  fallback in both test adapters.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — project changelog compiled from git history.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-03-31

### Changed

- Simplified single-module Contract + Facade definition pattern — more compact
  module definitions when contract and facade live in the same module.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-03-31

### Changed

- Upgraded `hex_port` to v0.11.0.

### Fixed

- Fixed dynamic compilation warning.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-03-31

### Changed

- Upgraded `hex_port` to v0.10.0 — gains explicit `:contract` option for
  `use HexPort.Facade` with separate contract modules.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added

- Support for same-module effectful Contract + Facade — a single module can
  now declare both the contract and the effectful facade.

### Changed

- Upgraded `hex_port` to v0.9.0 — gains single-module Contract + Facade
  support upstream.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-03-31

### Changed

- Introduced explicit `EffectfulContract` module — clearer separation of
  the effectful behaviour generation from the contract declaration.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-03-31

### Changed

- Extracted `Effects.Port.Facade` as the dispatch facade pattern.
- Renamed `Repo` to `Repo.Contract` + `Repo` facade — the contract declares
  operations, the facade provides the caller-facing API.
- Upgraded `hex_port` to v0.8.0 — gains built-in `Repo.Contract` with
  `Repo.Test` and `Repo.InMemory` test doubles, plus `MultiStepper`.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-03-30

### Changed

- `Repo.InMemory` fallback function now receives `(operation, args, state)`
  instead of `(operation, args)` — the state argument enables fallbacks that
  compose canned data with records inserted during the test.
- Upgraded `hex_port` to v0.7.0.
- Made `Repo.Test` and `Repo.InMemory` handlers more consistent.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-03-30

### Changed

- Consistent handler patterns for `Repo.Test` and `Repo.InMemory`.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-03-30

### Changed

- Upgraded `hex_port` to v0.6.0 — `HexPort.Contract.__using__/1` is now
  idempotent (safe to `use` multiple times).

## [0.12.1] — 2026-03-30

### Changed

- Upgraded `hex_port` to v0.3.1 — fixes Dialyzer `unknown_type` errors by
  expanding type aliases at macro time in `defport`.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-03-30

### Changed

- Updated `Skuld.Effects.Port.Contract` to use `HexPort.Contract` directly
  (no `.Port` generation).
- Updated documentation for Contract/Port separation.

## [0.11.1] — 2026-03-29

### Changed

- Pass `otp_app` option through `Port.Contract` to HexPort for plain dispatch.

### Added

- Remote `hex_port` hex dependency (previously vendored/inline).

## [0.11.0] — 2026-03-29

### Changed

- Moved effectful caller functions from `X` to `X.EffectPort` for symmetry
  with the HexPort/EffectPort architecture.

- Refactored `Port.Contract` to delegate to HexPort for plain layers.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- `Repo.InMemory` — stateful in-memory Repo handler with read-after-write
  consistency for PK-based lookups.
- Stateful Port test handler functions via `Port.with_stateful_handler/4`.

### Changed

- Updated documentation with real stateful handler API and honest Mox
  comparison.
- Removed redundant `__port_effectful__?/0` from `Adapter.Plain`.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-03-28

### Changed

- Renamed `Adapter.Direct` to `Adapter.Plain` for consistent terminology.

## [0.8.3] — 2026-03-28

### Changed

- Redesigned `Adapter.Direct`: config-based dispatch with `otp_app`,
  `config_key`, and `default` options.
- Added `__port_effectful__?/0` returning `false` to Direct adapters.
- Documented testing plain hexagons with Mox against Port contract's Plain
  behaviour.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-03-28

### Changed

- Auto-detect effectful resolvers via `__port_effectful__?/0` marker — checks
  the return value, not just existence.
- Port log now accumulated directly in `State.log`, removing `Writer`
  dependency.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- Credo compliance fixes.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- Port-level dispatch logging via `Port.State` struct — logs are accumulated
  in handler state rather than using a separate Writer effect.

### Changed

- Removed logging from `Port.Repo` (now handled at the Port level).

## [0.7.2] — 2026-03-27

### Changed

- Unified Port dispatch into a single merged registry with default resolvers.

  registry.

  non-effectful (plain function) dispatch.

- Effectful / Plain rename — clearer terminology for the two dispatch modes.
- Renamed generated Port modules for clarity.
- Updated documentation: replaced DB effect patterns with Transaction + Port
  patterns.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-26

### Added

- `Transaction` effect — for transactional boundaries without coupling to
  a specific DB implementation.
- `def_op_struct` — generates typed operation structs from effect definitions.

### Changed

- Inline effect constructor functions generated by `def_op` and
  `def_tagged_op`.
- Removed `DB` effect (replaced by Transaction + Port pattern).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-26

### Changed

- New minimal-allocation operation macros: `def_op` (renamed from
  `def_simple_op`), `def_tagged_op`, `def_op_struct`.

  `Random`, `Command`, `Port`, `Parallel`, `Reader`, `Writer`.
- Unified state keys to use sig atoms instead of tuples.
- Per-tag module-atom sigs for State effect performance.
